      "answer": "Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [\u02c8alb\u025b\u0281t \u02c8\u0294a\u026an\u0283ta\u026an] (listen); 14 March 1879 \u2013 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\"."
